#2.1
#1. int float bool complex
#2 print(3*8.7) 
#3 the answer to number two is a float 
#4 int(5.67) 
#5 A * B would go first, then the answer of that would be subtracted by C

#2.2
#1 true division divides the two numbers as floats and gives the exact decimal answer. Floor division rounds to the  in front of the decimal point
#2 it rounds the number down to the nearest integer
#3 5
#4 (a) is raising (B/C) to the power of A and (b) is raising B to the power of A, and then dividing the answer by C 
#5 round(a/b)

#2.3
#1 This means 4 < 5 which would be True
#2 this means 4 not equal to 4 which would be False
#3 this means 2 is equal to 2 which would be True
#4 1 < 3 < 5.0 which would be true
#5 1 < 2 is True and 2 > 1 which is True

#2.4
#1 when they are assigned a data type
#2 after the variable is created
#3 a-b
#4 because c is not a variable
#5 yes you can chnage the value of a variable at anytime

#3.1
#1 string, lists, tuples, 
#2 name = 'logan' print(name)
#3 single quotes for single words symbol-like strings and double quotes around natural language 
#4 mostly for style reasons
#5 when you declare integer 5 as a variable declare it in string format like '5'

#3.2
#1 to show where the escape sequence starts
#2 \t
#3 \n
#4 print("Blue\nGreen\nOrange\n")
#5 print("Orange\tApple\tBanana")

#3.3 
#1 r
#2 raw strings treat characters such as backslashes as a character instead of an operator
#3 
#4 docstrings and spanning multiple lines
#5 'Logan' + 'Gamble' join('Logan','Gamble')

#3.4
#1 animal='Gorilla'
#2 print(animal[0])
#3 print(animal[len(animal)-1])
#4 n=0
#  print(animal[n])
#  while n != len(animal)-1:
#    if n % 2 == 0:
#        n = n + 1
#        print(animal[n])
#    else:
#        n = n + 1
#5 animal.replace('l', 'b')

#4.1
#1 it is the ability for one variable to switch data types
#2 it means that the variable can take many forms
#3 it will say cute is the object, then it will declare dog as the varibale. Finally, it will link the variable and object
#4 variables - entries in a system with space for links to objects
#    objects -  pices of allocated memory with enough space to represent themselves with values
#   References - auto pointers from variable to objects
#5 When a variable is assigned to a new object the old object will never be used again and is deleted from the memory#6 yes that is possible and common
#7 a will be callable under 6 and under 'lamp' given context, but 'lamp' overides the number 6
#8 if the value of an object can change it is mutable, otherwise immutable
#9 int float string
#10 265
#11 it tells you the reference count of an object
#12 in the context of python it is when a function permits entities of different data types to be called upon
